\section{Conclusions}

-what about randomization? probably should talk about that some - not really a systematic error but it is if we want to combine results with someone else


Include total error table here of just my errors (not everybody elses)

- probably include one line which is the error if all the errors were uncorrelated

- include a reference to David's combination note \cite{CombinationNote} - Table 3 
- potentially include a reference to the uncertainty spreadsheet \cite{UncertaintySpreadsheet}
