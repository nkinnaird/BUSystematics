\section{Introduction}

- add a table of contents to the front page

- flesh out abstract a little bit more

- in the language for the whole document, might want to be a little more careful with my langauge, active voice, systematic ``unceratinty'' rather than ``error'', etc.

- this document contains errors calculated within the analysis, and does not detail the errors like the phase acceptance, muon loss phase, etc. which are calculated outside the analysis (and some of these errors are larger - probably cite something here pointing to these guys or preliminary estimates of these guys)

- in all cases the systematic errors are much less than the statistical (cite statistical somewhere? probably David's combination note)


- mention that these datasets are sometimes referenced as 1a, ... and connect those to 60h...
