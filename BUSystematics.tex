\title{Systematic Errors in the BU Analysis}
\author{Nicholas Kinnaird}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	This note serves to document how the systematic errors are evaluated in the BU analysis for the Run~1 publication of the E989 experiment. Most of the systematic errors are calculated in the way described in the authors PhD thesis \cite{phdthesis:2020Kinnaird}, however some of them have been updated. Those which have been updated are explained here briefly with some example plots

% notes: Need to decide what to do about errors that are not calculated in my own analysis but which apply as an error.
% Should probably include the actual numbers in this document as well in the form of tables for each dataset.
